## EDIT · rules
- PENDING items only, one short line each, edited in place. Remove an item when done (evidence goes in PATH-FREEZE.md / lane files).
- Line form: `- [ ] ID task · OWNER · STATUS · current fact → DEP.ID` ; "→ X" means this item waits on X (each → is a link).
- Gate ids per die are PFX.INFRA / PFX.GRT / PFX.CLK / PFX.BIND / PFX.STA.
- OWNER 12.18 (2026-10-29 05:44 PDT): full-gate census per die -> lanes/CLOSURE-LIST.tsv (fixed list); rule freeze (new checks only by owner); hourly burn-down open/closed/added; all 5 dies in parallel.
- OWNER 12.17 (2026-10-29 05:31 PDT): freeze plan on die GRT0+clock pass (fix-only after); one clock tool ot_clk.py for all dies; 2 parallel fix variants per failing gate; strict bind clean before GRT counts.
- DIE METHOD = METHODOLOGY s12 v5.1 (v5.0: early taps = macro insertion balancing, AOCV 0.21%/mm gates; v5.1: trims/useful skew/pads sparse <=~5% + CLOCK-RESIDUAL ledger after structural fix; 5%/15% cost = targets) (OWNER 10-26, frozen; change only on measured failure + owner decision): 12.7 MASTER PLAN FIRST per die (census -> corridors <=0.6 -> bays <=405 um every path/layer -> M7 entry pins -> worst-case PG, PG-shielded clock, islands clock/reset only, one core latency) + static plan gates incl. analytic predictor BEFORE any block build; kits carry a plan slice. 12.8 clock by construction: plan-defined centre clock entry per core, 250 ps TT, structured core trees; NO early taps / post-measurement trims / clock ECOs / mesh-node CPPR (plan-computed per-tap sizing OK). Freeze = GRT0 incl clock (>=50 it) + DIE STA with the real clock on related pairs (TT setup, FF hold; CPPR to last tree node); 80 ps skew = design target only. v4.6-4.9: MSCTS H-tree->ONE continuous mesh (signed mesh = CPPR point)->short local trees; clock OCV = depth/distance table (draft, owner review); droop shared (clock charged differential only); data hold buffers allowed. 12.9: one owner per die plan/clock (lanes/OWNERS-DIE.md); gate numbers via NUMBER-CHECK.
- Release gate = die STA on real views + token pass.
- Status words: RUNNING WAITS TODO NEW COORD OWNER FAIL PASS FROZEN BLOCKED NOT RUN.
